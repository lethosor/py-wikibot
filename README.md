py-wikibot
==========

MediaWiki bot framework in Python, with an uncreative name.

Usage
-----
See the [wiki](https://github.com/lethosor/py-wikibot/wiki) for some documentation. See [this repo](https://github.com/lethosor/LethosorBot-dfwiki) for working examples. Some out-of-date examples can also be found in the wikibot_samples folder.

Contributing
------------
Feel free to, as long as you can figure out what it does. Parts of it are better-documented than others. I hope to clean things up when I can. (Not that this isn't usableâ€“I use it for nearly all of my bot tasks).
