py-wikibot
==========

MediaWiki bot framework in Python

(Yes, I know the name is uncreative)

Usage
-----
See the [wiki](https://github.com/lethosor/py-wikibot/wiki) for some documentation. Some examples (not always up-to-date) can be found in the wikibot_samples folder.


Contributing
------------
Half of the code is poorly-commented and the other half is poorly-written (I'll clean it up eventually). Feel free to contribute if you can figure out what it does, though.
